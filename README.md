# Gas Dynamics

This repository contains notebooks written by Prof. Kyle Niemeyer at Oregon State University for the course Gas Dynamics (ME 461/561).

Each notebook represents a single class/lesson. Code is written in Python.

This is very much a work in progressâ€”at first, the notebooks may just be a translation of my lecture notes. 
However, I hope to continue improving them. Any suggestions or pull requests are welcome!
